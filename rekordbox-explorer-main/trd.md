# Rekordbox Explorer — Technical Reference

> **Branch note.** This describes the architecture of the **editor** release, which lives
> on **`for-later`** — not on `main`. `main` is the stable viewer: `src/lib/rekordbox-parser.ts`
> plus the components, with no `lib/pdb/`, `lib/usb/` or `lib/export/`. See `memorystate.md`
> for why, and `roadmap.md` for what re-lands where.

How it is built and why. Format details live in `research_playlistHelp.md`.

---

## 1. Stack

React 18 · Vite 7 (SWC) · TypeScript · Tailwind 3 · shadcn/ui (Radix) · Vitest.
No backend, no state library, no data-fetching library — there is no network to fetch from.

## 2. Layering

```
                     ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  components/        │ LibraryView · PlaylistEditor        │  React, no binary logic
                     │ BackupsDialog · DevicesDialog       │
                     │ PlayerBar · RecoveryDialog          │
                     └───────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                                     │

                                     │
                     ┌───────────────┴─────────────────────┐
  lib/usb/           │ commit · backup · fs · recovery-note │  drive I/O, orchestration
  lib/recovery/      │ assess · engine · xml                │  read-only triage
                     └───────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                                     │
  lib/pdb/           │ playlists · structure · devicesql    │  pure binary codec
  lib/audio/         │ formats · aiff · wav                 │  pure binary codec
  lib/               │ playlist-draft · export/ · zip       │  pure logic
```

**The rule:** everything below `hooks/` is pure or I/O-only and unit tested. No React
imports below `hooks/`. No `DataView` above `lib/`.

## 3. Module map

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `lib/pdb/devicesql.ts` | DeviceSQL string encode/decode. Honours `DataView.byteOffset`. |
| `lib/pdb/structure.ts` | File header, table pointers, page headers, row index, chain walking. Bounds and cycle guards. |
| `lib/pdb/playlists.ts` | Playlist row codecs + the additive writer + `verifyWrittenPlaylists`. |
| `lib/rekordbox-parser.ts` | Row layouts → `Track` / `Playlist`. Drive discovery. Formatters. |
| `lib/playlist-draft.ts` | Pure immutable edit model. Every op returns a new draft. |
| `lib/usb/fs.ts` | File System Access wrappers, permissions, SHA-256, safe filenames, downloads. |
| `lib/usb/backup.ts` | Dual-vault snapshots, verification, rotation, restore. |
| `lib/usb/commit.ts` | The 8-step write pipeline with automatic rollback. |
| `lib/usb/recovery-note.ts` | `WHATTODOIFTHISWENTTOSHIT.txt` generator. |
| `lib/device-registry.ts` | IndexedDB index of drives, cross-drive search, advice. |
| `lib/export/exporters.ts` | CSV / M3U8 / TXT / JSON / rekordbox XML. Pure strings. |
| `lib/pdf-export.ts` | PDF (lazy-loaded jsPDF) and print. |
| `lib/zip.ts` | Store-only ZIP writer for backup archives. |
| `lib/audio/formats.ts` | Runtime codec probe → `native` \| `decode` \| `unsupported`. Cached per extension. |
| `lib/audio/aiff.ts` · `wav.ts` | Hand-written PCM decoders. No audio dependency in the tree. |
| `lib/recovery/{assess,engine,xml}.ts` | Damaged-drive triage, Engine DJ reader, XML emitter. Read-only. |

## 4. The write pipeline

`commitPlaylists()` in `lib/usb/commit.ts`. Each step reports progress so the UI shows a
live checklist rather than a spinner.

| # | Step | Failure behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `permission` | Abort. Nothing touched. |
| 2 | `read` | Abort. |
| 3 | `backup` — both vaults, SHA-256 verified | **Hard gate.** Abort if no vault verifies. |
| 4 | `build` — additive image in memory | Abort. Drive untouched. |
| 5 | `verify-image` — re-parse the in-memory buffer | Abort. Drive untouched. |
| 6 | `write` | **Roll back** from step 3's backup. |
| 7 | `verify-drive` — re-read, compare SHA-256, re-parse | **Roll back.** |
| 8 | `finalise` — refresh the recovery note | Non-fatal. |

Rollback is best-effort and never throws; if it also fails, the message names the backup ID
and points at the on-drive `.txt`.

## 5. Backup vault layout

```
<USB>/
  WHATTODOIFTHISWENTTOSHIT.txt
  RBXPLORER_BACKUPS/                          ← vault 1 (root)
    manifest.json                             ← human-readable, never trusted
    2026-08-05T00-30-12-345Z_pre-write/
      export.pdb
      exportExt.pdb
      backup.json                             ← self-describing: sizes + SHA-256
  PIONEER/rekordbox/
    export.pdb                                ← the live library
    RBXPLORER_SAFETY/                         ← vault 2 (different tree)
      …same snapshots…
```

Four rules this layout encodes:

1. **Two vaults in two trees.** Deleting one folder cannot take the history with it.
2. **Nothing is trusted until read back.** Every copy is re-read and hashed against source.
3. **The manifest is a convenience, never a dependency.** Listing scans directories; each
   snapshot self-describes. A lost `manifest.json` costs nothing.
4. **Rotation deletes only after a new snapshot verifies**, and never the one just created.

Snapshot IDs carry milliseconds plus a collision suffix — two backups in the same second
(manual immediately followed by pre-write) must not collide. This was a real bug the tests
caught.

## 6. Safety invariants

These are enforced by tests, not by convention:

1. **A write only ever appends.** Verified by diffing the entire original region and
   asserting every changed byte is a file-header field, a table pointer, or a chain-graft
   `next_page` — `playlists.test.ts`, *"preserves every original byte and only appends"*.
2. **No write without a verified backup.** `commit.test.ts`, *"aborts before writing when
   the backup cannot be verified"*.
3. **A failed write rolls back.** `commit.test.ts`, *"rolls back automatically when the
   drive fails verification after writing"*.
4. **A restore is undoable.** `backup.test.ts`, *"the pre-restore snapshot can itself be
   restored"*.
5. **A damaged copy never overwrites a good library.** `backup.test.ts`, *"aborts without
   touching the database when the source fails its checksum"*.
6. **Malformed input never hangs or throws out of the parser.** Cycle guards, bounds
   checks, per-row try/catch.

## 6a. Audio playback

Two engines behind one state hook (`useAudition`):

| Route | When | How |
|---|---|---|
| `<audio>` | The browser decodes the format | Object URL from the `File`; native transport |
| Web Audio | It does not | Decode to `AudioBuffer`, play through an `AudioBufferSourceNode` |

`formats.ts` decides which, by **probing at runtime** rather than matching an extension
list. Which formats a browser refuses depends on the build — Chrome ships AAC, a
codec-less Chromium does not, and both return `""` from `canPlayType` — so a static list
is wrong on somebody's machine and the failure mode is silence.

The decoders exist because Chrome cannot play AIFF by either route, and Chrome is the
only browser with the File System Access API this app needs. Two implementation notes
that are easy to get backwards: **8-bit AIFF is signed, 8-bit WAV is unsigned**, and both
decoders clamp to the bytes present rather than the length the chunk header declares —
a file rescued off a failing drive still claims its original size.

A buffer source cannot be paused, so position is tracked with `startedAt`/`offset` and a
new node is created on resume. ALAC is the one rekordbox format nothing here can play; it
is reported by name, with the note that the track still plays on a CDJ.

## 7. Testing

`npm test` — 252 tests on `for-later`, 85 on `main`. No network, no real filesystem.

Two fixtures do the heavy lifting:

- **`test/fixtures/pdb-fixture.ts`** builds synthetic `.pdb` images. Written
  *independently* of the writer — it packs rows tightly where the writer 4-byte-aligns them
  — so round-trip tests cross-check two implementations rather than confirming the writer
  agrees with itself.
- **`test/fixtures/memory-fs.ts`** is an in-memory File System Access API with **fault
  injection**: `failWritesMatching`, `corruptWritesMatching`, `failMkdirMatching`. This is
  what makes "what happens when the drive starts failing mid-write" a unit test instead of
  a hope.

| Suite | Covers |
|---|---|
| `pdb/devicesql.test.ts` | All three encodings, surrogate pairs, bounds, nonzero `byteOffset` |
| `pdb/playlists.test.ts` | Read, write, byte-preservation, multi-page, validation, cycles |
| `rekordbox-parser.test.ts` | Row layouts, near/far name offsets, presence bitmap, malformed input |
| `playlist-draft.test.ts` | Every edit operation, immutability, diffing |
| `usb/backup.test.ts` | Dual vaults, verification, rotation, restore, corruption |
| `usb/commit.test.ts` | All 8 steps, rollback, abort paths |
| `export/exporters.test.ts` | Escaping — CSV formula injection, M3U8 line injection, XML |
| `audio/aiff.test.ts` · `wav.test.ts` | Bit depths, endianness, signedness, truncation, compressed variants. These are the *only* proof the decoders work — Chrome cannot decode AIFF, so there is nothing to cross-check against. |
| `audio/formats.test.ts` | The probe's three outcomes, and that an unsupported format names itself |
| `library-check.test.ts` | Legacy vs OneLibrary detection, per-generation support, playlist comparison |

## 8. Browser support

| Capability | Chrome / Edge / Opera | Safari / Firefox / iOS |
|---|---|---|
| Open a folder | ✅ | ❌ |
| Read `export.pdb` | ✅ | ✅ via file picker |
| Edit, back up, restore | ✅ | ❌ |
| Audition tracks | ✅ (AIFF/WAV decoded locally) | ✅ for the single file picked |
| Export / print | ✅ | ✅ |

Write support is gated on `supportsWriteAccess()` — `showDirectoryPicker` plus
`FileSystemFileHandle.prototype.createWritable`. The directory is picked `mode: 'read'` and
upgraded to `readwrite` only when the user first tries to write, so read-only visitors are
never prompted.

`createWritable()` writes through a swap file and swaps on close, so a crash mid-write
leaves the original intact.

## 9. Security

- **No secrets.** No `.env`, no keys, no server. `.gitignore` covers `.env*` and
  `*.tsbuildinfo`.
- **CSP** in `vercel.json`; `script-src` has no `'unsafe-inline'`.
- **CSV formula injection** neutralised — cells starting `= + - @` get a leading apostrophe.
  Track metadata comes from a file we did not write.
- **M3U8 / XML injection** — newlines stripped, XML-illegal control characters removed.
- **Filenames** derived from track data pass through `safeFileName()`.
- **Bounded allocation** — file size cap, table/page/row caps, cycle guards on hostile input.
- **Analytics** — `@vercel/analytics` sends page views only. Disclosed in `PRIVACY.md`.
- **XSS** — no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` anywhere. The print window builds HTML from
  escaped strings only.

## 10. Performance

- jsPDF (~400 KB) is dynamically imported. Main bundle 981 KB → 560 KB.
- `exportExt.pdb` merging is skipped below 768 px, where it costs the most.
- Parsing is synchronous on the main thread. A ~10k-track library is ~200 ms; a Web Worker
  is the next step if that becomes a complaint.
- Device track indexes live in IndexedDB, not localStorage — ten libraries would blow the
  5 MB string quota.

## 11. Conventions

- Pure logic gets a colocated `*.test.ts`.
- Comments explain *why*, especially for byte offsets and safety decisions.
- Errors are written for a DJ, not a developer: what happened, what state the drive is in,
  what to do.
- No `console.log` in shipping paths — the old parser emitted one per album.
