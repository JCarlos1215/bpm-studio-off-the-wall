# Memory State

Everything a cold reader — human or agent — needs to pick this project up without
re-deriving it. **Read this first.**

**Updated:** 2026-09-01 · **Live version:** 0.2.x (viewer) · **Parked version:** 0.3.0 (editor)

---

## 1. Where things stand right now

| | |
|---|---|
| **Production** | `rekordbox-explorer.vercel.app` — the **viewer**, current with `main`. The Instant-Rollback pin is gone; pushes auto-promote again. |
| **`main`** | The stable viewer, plus everything added since the rollback: drive compatibility check, OneLibrary reading, USB recovery, audition player |
| **`for-later`** | The full playlist-**editor** release, parked and unmerged, kept in step with every `main` feature above |
| **PR #9** | Merged, then rolled back. History intact. |

Both branches build clean and pass their suites — `main` 85 tests, `for-later` 252.
Everything added since the rollback is now live.

### How we got here

1. The editor release (PDB writer, backups, commit pipeline, device registry, exports,
   parser rewrite, 155 tests) was built, merged as PR #9 (`30d7ec3`), and deployed.
2. Vercel built it fine — `dpl_CZJ44hd6` went `READY`.
3. **The user hit issues in production and used Vercel Instant Rollback.** The specific
   symptom was never captured. This is the single biggest open question in the project.
4. To match git to reality, `main` was reverted **forward** to the `53fc8af` tree
   (force-push is blocked by a repo ruleset, and a forward revert is better anyway —
   auditable, and re-landing is one `git revert`).
5. The original scaffold icons were replaced with the hard-drive-in-a-circle mark.

### Instant Rollback pinned the production alias — resolved 2026-09-01

For a long stretch after the rollback, new deployments built and went `READY` but were
**never promoted**: Instant Rollback holds the production alias on the deployment it
rolled back to, and nothing in the Vercel UI says so on the deployment page. Every push
to `main` looked successful and changed nothing for users.

**That pin has since been lifted and pushes auto-promote again.** Verified by fetching
`rekordbox-explorer.vercel.app` and finding the current build's CSS — not by reading a
status field, because the deployment record listed the production alias while the pin was
still in force.

If it ever recurs, the symptom is a large `age:` header and stale HTML on the live URL
while a newer deployment sits `READY`. The fix is **Promote to Production** on that
deployment, or `vercel promote <deployment-url>`. The check that actually settles it is
fetching a hashed asset from the live domain and looking for something only the new build
contains.

## 1b. Deployment topology

Verified 2026-09-01 against the Vercel API and by fetching both URLs. Project
`prj_wy7F1HyK98thD0ggXxb8JaHMAkWV`, team `team_2sVeVCDGjXW2eMc1O6Qr78l5`.

| Target | Branch | URL | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Production** | `main` | `rekordbox-explorer.vercel.app` | ✅ auto-builds **and promotes**; serving current `main` |
| **Preview** | `for-later` | `rekordbox-explorer-git-for-later-carlosfranzettis-projects.vercel.app` | ✅ auto-builds, `READY`, `noindex` |

Three git branches exist on the remote:

| Branch | Role |
|---|---|
| `main` | Stable viewer. Deploys to production automatically. |
| `for-later` | Parked editor release. Auto-deploys to the branch preview alias above. |
| `claude/rekordbox-playlist-export-7wndye` | Stale working branch, superseded by the two above. Safe to delete. |

**`for-later` needed no configuration to get a preview URL.** Vercel builds a preview for
every pushed branch by default, and gives each branch a stable alias of the form
`<project>-git-<branch>-<owner>.vercel.app` that always points at that branch's newest
build. Push to `for-later` and the preview updates itself.

### Public access: production is open, every preview is gated

The project has **Vercel Deployment Protection** on:

```
ssoProtection:      { enabled: true, deploymentType: "all_except_custom_domains" }
passwordProtection: disabled
trustedIps:         disabled
custom domains:     none — only *.vercel.app hostnames
```

Do not read `all_except_custom_domains` literally — it does **not** mean "everything that
isn't a custom domain is gated." Probing all three hostnames settles what it actually does:

| Hostname | Response |
|---|---|
| `rekordbox-explorer.vercel.app` — the production domain | `200`, full HTML, `x-vercel-cache: HIT`, no auth challenge |
| `rekordbox-explorer-git-main-…vercel.app` — branch alias | `302 → vercel.com/sso-api`, `x-robots-tag: noindex` |
| `rekordbox-explorer-git-for-later-…vercel.app` — branch alias | `302 → vercel.com/sso-api`, `x-robots-tag: noindex` |

That is exactly Vercel's **Standard Protection**: the *production domain* is exempt;
deployment URLs, branch aliases and previews are all gated. The `.vercel.app` production
alias counts as exempt alongside any custom domain.

So: **anyone can use the live app. Nobody outside the Vercel team can open the preview,
and the preview will never be indexed** — which is the right default for a branch carrying
an un-diagnosed rollback.

To share the preview with a specific person without turning protection off, use Vercel's
per-deployment **Share** link (it mints a `_vercel_share` token) rather than flipping the
project setting.

Sanity-check any of this in a private/incognito window — one second, no API archaeology.

### Analytics: script present, collection off

`<Analytics />` from `@vercel/analytics/react` is mounted in `src/App.tsx` on **both**
branches, and `vitals.vercel-insights.com` is allowed in the `connect-src` CSP in
`vercel.json`. So the beacon fires from both deployments.

But **Web Analytics is not enabled on the Vercel project** — the API returns
`404 Web Analytics not found`. Beacons are sent and dropped; no data is being retained for
either deployment. Enabling it is a dashboard action with no API/MCP equivalent:
**Vercel → Project → Analytics → Enable**. It covers production and preview together;
there is no per-deployment switch.

Note the interaction with protection: once enabled, production would record real public
traffic, but the previews would only ever record logged-in team members — so preview
numbers will look near-empty by design, and that is not a bug.

## 1c. Solved: "Invalid number of tables: 1179011393"

A user hit this on production. **It was not a bug in the parser and nothing was
corrupt — they picked the wrong file.**

`1179011393` is `0x46464941`, which little-endian is the ASCII bytes **`AIFF`**.
An AIFF file is `"FORM"`, a 4-byte size, then `"AIFF"` at offset `0x08` — exactly
where the PDB header keeps its table count. The parser read an audio file and
faithfully reported what it found there.

This is a mobile-shaped failure. iOS has no File System Access API, so the app
falls back to a bare file input and the Files app offers the user their music.

Fixed 2026-08-27 by `src/lib/file-sniff.ts`, which identifies a file from its
magic bytes before parsing and says what it actually is (AIFF, WAV, MP3, FLAC,
M4A, Ogg, ZIP, PDF, image, XML, plain SQLite, or an encrypted OneLibrary
database). The file input also carries an `accept` hint now, but iOS ignores it
freely, so the byte check is the real gate.

**The general lesson is worth more than the fix**: a validation error that
echoes a raw parsed number is unactionable. Say what the file is.

---

## 1d. OneLibrary works — reading *and* writing

Verified 2026-08-27 against a real encrypted export. This reverses the roadmap's
long-standing "deliberately not doing: writing Device Library Plus".

**The whole chain runs in the browser with WebCrypto only** — no WASM, no native
module, no server:

```
exportLibrary.db → decrypt (WebCrypto) → SQLite read → edit playlists
                 → rebuild → encrypt (WebCrypto) → verify → drive
```

Parameters, all confirmed by decrypting a real file (25 pages in 155 ms):

| | |
|---|---|
| Cipher | AES-256-CBC, no padding |
| Page size | 4096, **reserve 80** = 16-byte IV + 64-byte HMAC-SHA512 |
| KDF | PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512, 256,000 iterations, 32-byte key |
| Salt | first 16 bytes of the file, in the clear |
| Passphrase | supplied as a **string**, never as a raw hex key |

That last row is the classic integration mistake: `PRAGMA key = 'abc…'` works
where `PRAGMA key = "x'abc…'"` fails, because the hex form tells SQLCipher to
skip the KDF entirely.

### The safety model is necessarily different here

The PDB writer's invariant 1 — *a write only ever appends* — **cannot hold for
SQLite**. Changing one value can change its serial type (a rating of 0 takes
zero bytes, a rating of 5 takes one), which grows the record, re-lays-out the
page, and can split the b-tree. So OneLibrary writes rebuild the whole file.

Invariants 2-6 still apply and matter more because of it. The compensating
control is that `applyPlaylistChanges` **decrypts and re-reads its own output**
before returning, so a database that would not open is caught in memory, before
anything goes near a drive.

### Bug caught by a test, worth remembering

The first writer silently renumbered `category_id` 26 → 21. Cause: an
`INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` column *is* the rowid — SQLite stores NULL in the record
and recovers the value from the b-tree key — and the writer defaults a missing
`__rowid` to the row's position. Any table with gaps in its ids got renumbered,
breaking every reference to it. Fixed by pinning `__rowid` from the declared id
during the snapshot. The test that caught it asserts every table *except* the
two playlist tables is unchanged; keep it.

### Still to wire up

The library layer is done and tested; the app does not use it yet. `useRekordbox`
still only looks for `export.pdb`, OneLibrary writes do not yet go through
`commitPlaylists`, and the WAL warning is returned but never displayed. See
roadmap P7.

### The WAL trap

rekordbox leaves most of a fresh export in the write-ahead log — a 118 KB
`exportLibrary.db` beside a 1.1 MB `exportLibrary.db-wal` is normal. Opening the
main file alone reports a nearly empty library **with no error at all**. We
cannot replay a WAL, so `loadOneLibrary` takes the `-wal` size and returns a
warning. Displaying it is not optional; a silently-truncated library is worse
than a visible failure.

### Provenance

The SQLCipher and SQLite layers are vendored verbatim from
[v1vendi/onelibrary](https://github.com/v1vendi/onelibrary) (MIT), kept as
unmodified `.js` with types alongside so upstream fixes apply as a clean diff.
See `docs/THIRD-PARTY.md`.

## 1e. Mobile layout: one layout, not a phone variant

Settled 2026-08-27 by the person who actually uses this on a phone, and it
contradicts both the conventional wisdom and an earlier code review.

`for-later` had "fixed" mobile by putting the playlist tree behind a hamburger
below 768px and cutting the track table to three flexible-width columns. On a
real phone that renders as **a single stretched Title column with no playlists
visible** — the flexible widths collapse whenever artist/album are empty. The
2026-08-14 review had called `main`'s unconditional `ResizablePanelGroup` the
bug and this drawer the fix. That was backwards.

**The rule now: a phone gets the same layout as a desktop.** Playlists beside the
tracks, the full column set, horizontal scroll to reach the rest. The panel is
resizable, so anyone who wants a full-width table can drag it there.

Reasoning worth keeping: the playlist tree *is* the app — hiding it costs a tap
on every navigation — and BPM is exactly what someone checks on their phone. The
generic mobile pattern optimises for content-first reading, which this is not.

Pinned by `src/components/LibraryView.mobile.test.tsx`, which asserts at 390px
that playlists render, no hamburger exists, and the column count matches desktop.
Do not "optimise mobile" past those tests without asking.

## 1f. A real drive was recovered — what worked

2026-08-27. A drive pulled without ejecting. All 52 playlists came back. The
technique generalises, and is now shipped as **Attempt USB recovery**.

### The diagnosis

All three rekordbox databases stopped at **exactly 32 KB**:

| File | Pages written | Declared | Present |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EXPORT.PDB` | 8 | 184 | 4.3% |
| `exportExt.pdb` | 5 real | 21 | 24% |
| `exportLibrary.db` | 9 (122 pages all-zero) | 131 | 7% |

Three separate files stopping at the same round number is the signature: the OS
flushed one write buffer per file and the drive went away. `exportLibrary.db` had
already been *extended* to its full 131 pages — the size was right — but 122 of
them were literally zeros.

**This is the distinction that matters: the data was absent, not corrupted.** No
repair tool can help. Saying "your file is corrupt" sends someone hunting for one
that cannot exist.

`export.pdb`'s `playlist_tree` starts at page 15 and `playlist_entries` at 17 —
both past the 8-page cutoff, which is why the playlists were unrecoverable there.

### What actually recovered it

**`Engine Library/Database2/m.db`** — 616 pages of a declared 620. **99.4%
intact**, because Engine was last written four days before the incident.

Two things made it readable:

1. **A forgiving b-tree walker, not a SQLite engine.** `sqlite3` refuses a
   truncated file outright (`database disk image is malformed`); the pure-JS
   walker reads whatever pages survived. That difference is the entire recovery.
2. **Engine is plain, unencrypted SQLite** — no key, no WAL games.

Result: 721 tracks, 52 playlists, 1,391 entries, zero orphans.

**Proof it was the same library:** every Engine track carries
`pdbImportKey = 7839`, which is exactly the `sequence` in the damaged
`export.pdb`. Engine had imported from that very file.

### Why the output is rekordbox XML, not a rebuilt export.pdb

Tempting, and wrong. A from-scratch PDB means synthesising every table with
correct DeviceSQL string offsets, and there is no way to validate the result
short of a CDJ. "It parses in our own reader" is not "a player accepts it in a
booth." rekordbox XML is documented and supported, and importing it makes
rekordbox write both device databases itself, reusing the ANLZ already on the
drive. One extra step, and correct.

### Techniques now encoded in `src/lib/recovery/`

- **Header-vs-size check** — PDB `next_unused_page x len_page`; SQLite header
  page count at offset 28. Catches truncation.
- **All-zero page census** — separates *unwritten* from *damaged*, which changes
  the advice completely.
- **Journal / `-wal` handling** — a **zero-length** `-journal` means the
  transaction committed and there is nothing to roll back (that was the case
  here). A non-empty one means a write was in flight. Neither can be replayed
  in a browser, so we say so rather than silently reading half a transaction.
- **OneLibrary decrypt then assess** — encryption hides blank pages entirely, so
  the assessment must run on the *decrypted* image.
- **Engine DJ as an alternate source** — the key insight: don't repair a broken
  library, find an intact one.
- **Score by playlists recovered, then tracks.** Playlists are what cannot be
  rebuilt by re-scanning a folder of audio.

### The rule worth remembering

**A drive rarely loses every library at once.** They are written at different
times by different software; whichever was open when the drive vanished loses
its unflushed pages, and the others are untouched. Recovery is a search problem,
not a repair problem.

## 1g. Audition player: the browser is the hard part, not the audio

2026-09-01, shipped on both branches. `src/lib/audio/`, `useAudition`, `PlayerBar`.

### Chrome cannot play AIFF, and Chrome is the only browser that can open a USB

Verified in headless Chromium, both routes: `canPlayType('audio/aiff')` returns
`""` and `decodeAudioData` throws `EncodingError`. Safari decodes AIFF happily and
has no folder picker. So on the one browser with the File System Access API this
app needs, the format most of a vinyl-leaning library is stored in is unplayable.

AIFF is uncompressed PCM in a chunked container, so `aiff.ts` decodes it directly —
arithmetic, not a codec. That is the difference between "auditioning does not work
for most of your library" and "it works". **Do not remove it as redundant.**

### Capability is probed, never hardcoded

Which formats fail varies by **build**, not just by browser: Chrome ships AAC, a
Chromium compiled without proprietary codecs does not, and *both report the same
empty string* from `canPlayType`. A hardcoded extension list is therefore wrong on
somebody's machine, and the failure mode is silence — the worst way to be wrong.
`formats.ts` probes once per extension and caches, resolving each file to `native`,
`decode`, or `unsupported`.

The decoders also serve as the fallback when native playback is advertised and then
fails anyway.

### Traps that cost real time

| Trap | What happens |
|---|---|
| **8-bit AIFF is signed, 8-bit WAV is unsigned** | Swap them and you get a loud DC offset, not a visible bug. Both directions are pinned by tests. |
| **Chunk headers declare the original length** | A file rescued off a dying drive is shorter than it claims. Decoders clamp to `bytes.length`, never to the header. Caught by the truncation test, not by inspection. |
| **`WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE`** | The real format tag hides at `body + 24` inside a GUID; the visible tag is `0xFFFE` for everything. |
| **Buffer sources cannot pause** | Web Audio `AudioBufferSourceNode` is one-shot. Position is tracked with `startedAt`/`offset` and a fresh node is created on resume. |
| **`copyToChannel` vs `getChannelData().set()`** | The former trips TypeScript's `Float32Array` variance under this config. Use the latter. |

### Layout decisions, each made against a screenshot

- **Contents capped at `max-w-3xl`, surface full width.** Left alone the seek
  control stretched past 2000px on a wide monitor, where one pixel is a fifth of a
  second — precision nobody aims for, and it dominated the layout. The surface still
  spans the viewport so it reads as a bar. Below the cap the constraint does nothing.
- **A floating bordered card, not a full-bleed strip.** Inset from all four edges;
  12px + safe-area on a phone so it clears the home indicator, 8px on desktop.
- **The seek row is padded on both sides.** The 18px handle plus its 3px ring nearly
  fills its own row, so flush against the transport a thumb aiming for the scrubber
  hits the play button. Measured: 23px above the track, 20px below, ring 11px clear
  of the buttons.
- **`--player-h` is measured to the bottom of the viewport**, not from the bar's own
  height — the bar floats, so the table must clear the gap too — and re-published on
  resize because the offset is viewport-relative. It is measured rather than a
  constant because the bar grows when an error line appears.

`preview.html` + `src/preview-main.tsx` render the real `TrackTable` and `PlayerBar`
against ten fixture tracks so all of this can be checked without a USB. Vite only
builds `index.html`, so the harness never ships.

---

## 2. The rollback: ranked suspects

Nobody captured the error, so this is analysis, not diagnosis. Ranked by how well each
explains "built clean, passed 155 tests, smoke-tested green, still broke for a real user".

**1. No React error boundary (most likely amplifier, whatever the trigger).**
`src/App.tsx` on `for-later` has no error boundary. Any component throwing during render
gives a **blank white page** with no message. That is exactly what "everything is broken"
looks like. Even if the trigger is one of the below, this is what turned it into a
catastrophic symptom instead of a visible error. **Fix this first regardless.**

**2. Parser got stricter and now throws where the old one coped.**
`src/lib/pdb/structure.ts` `readFileHeader()` throws when
`view.byteLength % lenPage !== 0`. The old parser never required the file size to be an
exact multiple of the page size. A real `export.pdb` with any trailing bytes now fails to
load **entirely**, where before it loaded fine. The old parser also allowed up to 1000
tables; the new one caps at 64. Verified by reading the code; **not** verified against a
real-world file, because we have never tested against one — every test uses synthetic
fixtures we generated ourselves, which are page-aligned by construction. **This is the
most plausible functional trigger and the tests are structurally blind to it.**

**3. `walkTablePages` stops on `page.type !== table.type`.**
Stricter than the old chain-walk. If a real chain interleaves pages, rows silently vanish
— a partial library rather than a crash.

**4. IndexedDB in the device registry.**
`rememberDevice()` runs on *every* successful load from `useRekordbox.ts`. The call is
`void rememberDevice(...).catch(() => {})` so a rejection is handled — but `openDb()`
caches `dbPromise` forever, so a first failure poisons it for the session, and
`onblocked` is unhandled (a second tab with an older schema hangs the open promise
rather than rejecting). Safari private mode is the classic environment for this.
**Analysed, plausible, not confirmed.**

**5. Stale localStorage settings.** Investigated and I believe this is **fine** —
`hydrate()` in `useSettings.ts` spreads over `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` and re-validates arrays
and numbers, so an old `{colorScheme, fontSize, hiddenColumns}` object upgrades cleanly.
Ruled out unless evidence says otherwise.

**6. `crypto.subtle` unavailable.** Only reachable on write/backup paths, not on load.
Would not break plain browsing. Low.

### 2026-08-14 review round — three suspects eliminated

A second independent review traced every call path and **narrowed the list above**. The
headline correction:

> **The page-alignment throw is caught.** `useRekordbox.ts` wraps every parse entry point
> — `selectFolder`, `reload`, `handleFileInput`, `performFullScan` — in `try/catch` and
> sets `status: 'error'`. So suspect #2 renders a visible error card, **not** a blank
> page. It is still a real regression (the app refuses files the old parser opened), but
> it cannot by itself produce the catastrophic symptom.

Also established, with call-path evidence:

- **Suspect #4 (IndexedDB) is ruled out as a cause of "library won't display."**
  `setStatus({ type: 'valid', ... })` runs *before* `rememberDevice()` is called, and the
  call is `void`-ed with a `.catch`. Success, rejection, or an indefinite hang cannot
  block or crash library display. The `dbPromise`-caches-a-rejection bug is real but
  silent and session-scoped. `onblocked` is unreachable until `DB_VERSION` bumps past 1.
- **Suspect #5 (localStorage) confirmed ruled out.** Object spread never overwrites a
  missing key with `undefined`; every new settings field keeps its default.
- **Suspect #6 (`crypto.subtle`) confirmed ruled out** — write paths only.
- **Suspect #3 got more interesting, not less.** `walkTablePages` returning on a type
  mismatch ends the *whole generator*, discarding every remaining page in the chain. The
  old parser skipped the bad page and kept walking. On a well-used drive with rekordbox's
  page-reuse mechanism, this yields a **silent partial library** — no error at all, just
  missing tracks. That is a harder symptom to describe than a crash, which fits "the
  specific symptom was never captured" better than anything else on the list.
- **No uncaught render-time throw was found anywhere in the codebase.** The error boundary
  is still the correct first fix, but as insurance against future bugs rather than as the
  explanation for this one.

Revised bet: **#2 or #3**, with genuinely low confidence in either. The honest conclusion
is unchanged and now doubly evidenced — this cannot be resolved without the original
console error or a real `export.pdb`.

### New defects found this round

- **`recovery-note.ts:115` lies about the Rescue tab.** The on-drive
  `WHATTODOIFTHISWENTTOSHIT.txt` promises Rescue "scans the whole drive for any
  recoverable database and offers to put it back." The actual tab
  (`BackupsDialog.tsx:411`) is static advice text with no scan action. This is the one
  document a DJ reads mid-incident with no internet. Fix the text or build the feature.
- **`console.log` per album on `main`** (`rekordbox-parser.ts:647`) — violated this repo's
  own rule, fired once per album row on every load. **Fixed 2026-08-14.**
- **Dead `rating > 255` check** on a `getUint8` — impossible condition dressed as a
  validation. Harmless, misleading.
- **`main` carried the original scaffold's bloat** — **cleared 2026-08-14.** 42 dead
  modules deleted (`NavLink.tsx`, 39 unreferenced shadcn components and variant files,
  two orphan hooks) and 35 unused packages removed, including `@tanstack/react-query`
  (imported in `App.tsx` with zero `useQuery` calls anywhere) and the scaffold's
  component-tagger Vite plugin. Verified by transitive reachability from `main.tsx` plus the test entry
  points, not by grep. The eager top-level `jspdf` import (~400 KB) is still there — see
  the roadmap.

### Security audit — clean

A separate audit of `for-later` covering untrusted binary parsing and write-path safety
found **no exploitable vulnerabilities**. Every `DataView` read is bounds-checked; every
chain walk has a `visited` set and a page cap; allocation is capped at four levels;
CSV/M3U8/XML/filename/print-HTML output is escaped with tests proving it; all six write
invariants are enforced with a hard gate and automatic rollback; no secrets; CSP has no
`script-src 'unsafe-inline'`; privacy claims verified (nothing but Vercel page views
leaves the browser).

### What to do about it

Before re-landing `for-later`: add an error boundary, relax the page-alignment check to a
warning, make `walkTablePages` skip-and-continue instead of truncating, and **test against
a real `export.pdb`** — the one gap no amount of synthetic fixture work closes. If the
user can supply the actual console error, most of this list collapses to one item.

## 3. Decisions, with reasons

| Decision | Why | Reversible? |
|---|---|---|
| **Additive PDB writes only** — append new pages, never overwrite | Original bytes provably survive; a failed write leaves recoverable data | Yes, but don't |
| **Playlist tables only** (types 7, 8) | 20-byte + 12-byte rows, no shared string tables. Metadata edits touch tables every other row references | Deliberately deferred |
| **Two backup vaults in two directory trees** | Losing one folder must not lose the history | No — core guarantee |
| **Manifest never trusted for listing** | A corrupt `manifest.json` is exactly when listing must still work | No |
| **4-byte row alignment** | Format targeted 16-bit hardware; costs bytes, removes a risk class | Yes |
| **Sample `page_flags` from existing pages** | Both `0x24` and `0x34` occur; mimic what rekordbox did on *this* drive | Yes |
| **Don't write Device Library Plus** | Key known, schema not, no working precedent, AlphaTheta can rotate it | Revisit if schema is documented |
| **Pick `mode:'read'`, upgrade on demand** | Read-only visitors should never see a write prompt | Yes |
| **IndexedDB for the device registry** | 10 libraries × 5k tracks blows localStorage's 5 MB | Yes |
| **Dropped `@tanstack/react-query`** | Zero `useQuery` calls existed. No network to fetch from | Yes |
| **Lazy-load jsPDF** | 400 KB for a feature most sessions never use | Yes |
| **Revert forward, don't force-push** | `main` is protected; forward revert is auditable and re-landing is one command | n/a |
| **Local icon assets** | The old favicon/og image were hotlinked from a third-party bucket — could vanish any time | n/a |

## 4. Bugs found and fixed (in the parked release)

1. **Backup ID collision.** Second-granularity timestamps meant a manual backup
   immediately followed by a pre-write backup overwrote each other. Now millisecond
   timestamps + a collision suffix. *Caught by a test, not by review.*
2. **`DataView.byteOffset` ignored** in the old string reader — latent, would break any
   future chunked parsing.
3. **Off-by-one** in long-form DeviceSQL string bounds (`>=` where `>` was meant).
4. **Album parsing was four stacked guesses** with a `console.log` per album firing in
   production. Replaced with the documented layout (`subtype & 0x04` → u16 at `0x16`,
   else u8 at `0x15`).
5. **No-op validations** — `rating > 255` on a `getUint8`, `length > 65535` on a
   `getUint16`. Removed.
6. **Mobile layout was broken.** The resizable two-pane shell rendered unconditionally,
   so a phone got a squeezed sidebar and a 1px mouse-only drag handle. Now a Sheet
   drawer below 768 px.
7. **39 unused shadcn components + 24 unused dependencies** shipped in the tree.
   `no-unused-vars` was disabled, so nothing caught them.

## 5. Landmines

- **`empty_candidate`, `index_shift`, and "strange" pages (`page_flags & 0x40`)** remain
  undocumented. Not known to matter for playlists. Not proven irrelevant.
- **A rekordbox re-export wipes device-only playlists.** Expected; users will be surprised.
- **CDJ-3000 firmware 3.30** prioritised OneLibrary and was pulled by AlphaTheta. If it
  returns, legacy-only drives stop working on that model.
- **Vercel rollback pins the alias** — see §1.
- **`main` is protected**; no force-pushes. Plan forward-only.
- **All testing is synthetic.** No real `export.pdb`, no real CDJ. See §2.

## 6. Test infrastructure (on `for-later`)

- **`src/test/fixtures/pdb-fixture.ts`** builds synthetic `.pdb` images. Written
  *independently of the writer on purpose* (tight packing vs. the writer's 4-byte
  alignment) so round-trip tests cross-check two implementations. **Do not refactor it to
  share the writer's encoding.**
- **`src/test/fixtures/memory-fs.ts`** is an in-memory File System Access API with fault
  injection — `failWritesMatching`, `corruptWritesMatching`, `failMkdirMatching`. This is
  how "the drive corrupts a write mid-commit" became a unit test.

252 tests across 16 suites. **Their blind spot: they only ever see files we generated.**
That is why the recovery and audio suites matter — they reproduce failure shapes
taken from a real casualty rather than shapes our own writers produce.

## 7. Key facts worth not re-deriving

- **PDB page header**: `0x08` type, `0x0C` next_page, `0x18` num_row_offsets (b13) +
  num_rows (b11), `0x1B` page_flags, `0x1C` free_size, `0x1E` used_size. Heap at `0x28`.
- **Row index** builds *backwards* from page end in `0x24`-byte groups of 16.
- **Playlist rows**: tree = `parent_id, _, sort_order, id, raw_is_folder, name` (20 B +
  string). Entry = `entry_index, track_id, playlist_id` (12 B fixed).
- **Player split**: CDJ-2000/3000(≤3.22)/XDJ read `export.pdb`. OPUS-QUAD, OMNIS-DUO,
  XDJ-AZ, CDJ-3000X need Device Library Plus.
- **The bridge**: rekordbox 6.6.11+ converts an on-device legacy library to Device
  Library Plus. That is how playlists written here reach newer gear.
- **Brand colours**: primary `hsl(200 100% 50%)` = `#00AAFF`; background
  `hsl(220 15% 8%)` = `#111317`.
- **Vercel**: project `prj_wy7F1HyK98thD0ggXxb8JaHMAkWV`, team
  `team_2sVeVCDGjXW2eMc1O6Qr78l5`.

## 8. Open items

1. **Get the actual rollback error.** Everything else is guessing.
2. Add an error boundary; relax the page-alignment throw. (`for-later`)
3. Test against a real `export.pdb` and real CDJ hardware.
4. Promote the current deployment (needs a human click).
5. Set GitHub topics — see `docs/TOPICS.md`.
6. Upload `public/og-image.png` as the GitHub social preview (separate setting; it does
   not read `og:image`).
7. **A corrupt USB is incoming.** A drive was pulled without ejecting and its
   database is now corrupt; the user is supplying it. Do not write a repair
   before seeing the image — see roadmap P8. Two things to do first regardless:
   take a byte-for-byte image and work only on copies, and **check the backup
   vaults**, because restore is already implemented and tested and may make the
   whole repair moot.
8. Wire OneLibrary into the app — the library layer is done, the load and commit
   paths do not use it yet (roadmap P7).

## 9. Vision context

This is the browser tier of something larger. **rickordbox** is the desktop ambition;
**djOS** is the umbrella; **RA-NYC** is the events/social side — locally moderated by
appointed ambassadors, suggesting contacts and events to visiting DJs, eventually routing
tours from attended-events history + Discogs + actual USB contents.

The shared primitive already exists: **the device registry** knows what is on which drive.

Note on rickordbox: its README claims "10× faster than rekordbox" by skipping analysis
and delegating it to the hardware. **CDJs do not analyse tracks.** An export with no ANLZ
files plays but shows no waveform, no beatgrid, no cues. Writing ANLZ is the real cost of
"actually works", and it is not small.

The through-line: **your library, your drives, your history — local-first, yours.**
