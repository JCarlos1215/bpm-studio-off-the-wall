# Rekordbox Explorer — CLAUDE.md

Browser-based viewer for rekordbox USB exports. Parses the binary `export.pdb` directly
in the browser — no server, no uploads.

## ⚠️ Read `memorystate.md` first

Two branches, and **which one you are on changes everything**:

| Branch | Contents | Deployed |
|---|---|---|
| **`main`** (this one) | The stable **viewer**. `src/lib/rekordbox-parser.ts` + components. | ✅ Yes |
| **`for-later`** | The **editor** release: `lib/pdb/`, `lib/usb/`, `lib/export/`, playlist editor, backups, device registry, recovery, the audition player, 252 tests. | ⏸️ Rolled back |

The editor was deployed and rolled back after production issues that were never
diagnosed. Do not re-land it without working through P0 in `roadmap.md`.

**Branch rule:** write path, editor, backups, device registry → **`for-later`**.
Low-risk viewer work and docs → **`main`**.

Deployment: pushes to `main` auto-promote to production again. Instant Rollback pinned
the alias for a long stretch after the rollback — builds went `READY` and changed nothing
for users — so if a change does not appear live, check that first. `memorystate.md` §1.

## Key Files (on `main`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/pages/Index.tsx` | Switches between LandingScreen and LibraryView |
| `src/components/LandingScreen.tsx` | File/folder selection |
| `src/components/LibraryView.tsx` | Sidebar + track table |
| `src/components/PlaylistSidebar.tsx` | Playlist tree, settings, theme/font |
| `src/components/TrackTable.tsx` | Resizable, sortable, drag-and-drop columns |
| `src/components/PlayerBar.tsx` | Audition transport, floating at the bottom |
| `src/lib/rekordbox-parser.ts` | Binary `.pdb` parser — the core engine |
| `src/lib/pdf-export.ts` | PDF generation |
| `src/lib/audio/formats.ts` | Runtime codec probe — native, decode, or unsupported |
| `src/lib/audio/aiff.ts` · `wav.ts` | Hand-written PCM decoders for what Chrome refuses |
| `src/lib/recovery/` | Damaged-drive recovery — read-only, XML out |
| `src/hooks/useRekordbox.ts` | Loading, File System Access API, state |
| `src/hooks/useAudition.ts` | Playback state, two engines, the play queue |
| `src/hooks/useSettings.ts` | localStorage preferences |
| `src/types/rekordbox.ts` | Track, Playlist, RekordboxDatabase |

## Dev Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # localhost:8080
npm run build
npm run preview
npm test
```

`preview.html` is a dev-only harness that renders the real `TrackTable` and `PlayerBar`
against fixture tracks, so the player can be looked at without a USB attached. Vite only
builds `index.html`, so it never ships.

## Important notes

- **File System Access API** for folders (Chrome/Edge/Opera). Safari/iOS falls back to a
  single-file input and is read-only.
- **Themes** are CSS variables in `src/index.css`: `dark`, `midnight`, `light` (sepia),
  `arctic`. Primary is `hsl(200 100% 50%)` = `#00AAFF`.
- **Icons** in `public/` are the hard-drive-in-a-circle mark, all local. The originals
  were hotlinked from a third-party bucket — never reintroduce a remote icon URL.
- **Binary parser** reads Pioneer's `.pdb` as an `ArrayBuffer`. When touching it, prefer
  *degrade gracefully* over *throw* — over-strict validation is a prime suspect for the
  rollback. See `database.md` §1 and `memorystate.md` §2.
- **No `console.log` in shipping paths.**

## If you are working on the write path (`for-later`)

Six invariants, each enforced by a test. Do not break them:

1. A write only ever **appends**; the only bytes patched in the original region are the
   file header's `sequence`/`next_unused_page`, playlist table pointers, and one
   chain-graft `next_page`.
2. No write without a **verified backup** in at least one vault.
3. A failed write **rolls back** automatically.
4. A restore is itself **snapshotted first**.
5. A damaged backup **never overwrites** a good library.
6. Malformed input never hangs or throws out of the parser.

Only playlist tables (types 7 and 8) are ever written.

## Recovery (`src/lib/recovery/`)

**Do not repair a broken library. Find an intact one.** A stick carries several
databases written at different times; the one that was open when the drive was
pulled loses its unflushed pages, the others are fine. That is a search problem.

- **Unwritten is not corrupt.** A file that stops on a page boundary, or is full
  of all-zero pages, was never finished being written. There is nothing to
  repair, and saying "corrupt" sends a DJ hunting for a tool that cannot exist.
  `assess.ts` draws that line; keep it drawn.
- Read damaged SQLite with the **forgiving b-tree walker**, never a real SQLite
  engine — `sqlite3` rejects a truncated file outright, the walker reads what
  survived. That is what made the original recovery possible.
- Assess OneLibrary **after** decrypting; encryption hides blank pages.
- Recovery is **read-only**. It never writes to the drive.
- Output is **rekordbox XML only**. Never synthesise an `export.pdb` — see
  `xml.ts` for why, and do not "improve" this without a CDJ to test against.

## Audition player (`src/lib/audio/`, `useAudition`, `PlayerBar`)

**Probe the browser, never hardcode a format list.** Which formats fail varies by
browser *and* by build: Chrome ships AAC, a Chromium compiled without proprietary
codecs does not, and both return the same empty string from `canPlayType`. A
hardcoded list is wrong on somebody's machine and the failure mode is silence.
`formats.ts` resolves each file to `native`, `decode` or `unsupported`.

- **Chrome cannot play AIFF at all** — not via `<audio>`, not via `decodeAudioData` —
  and Chrome is the only browser with the File System Access API this app needs. Most
  of a vinyl-leaning library is AIFF, so `aiff.ts` decodes it directly. Do not delete
  it as redundant; nothing else can play those tracks.
- **8-bit AIFF is signed; 8-bit WAV is unsigned.** Getting this backwards produces a
  loud DC offset rather than an obvious bug. Both directions are pinned by tests.
- Decoders **clamp to the bytes actually present**, never to the length a chunk header
  claims. A rescued file declares its original size; trusting that reads past the end.
- A format nothing can decode (ALAC) is **named in the message**, with the reassurance
  that the track still plays on a CDJ. Never fail silently.
- The bar publishes `--player-h`, measured to the bottom of the viewport, and the track
  table reserves that much padding. It is measured rather than a constant because the
  bar grows when an error line appears.
- **Leave the padding around the seek row alone.** The handle is 18px with a 3px ring,
  so its hit area nearly fills its row; without the gap, a thumb aiming for the
  scrubber lands on the play button.

## Writing for users

Error messages are read by a DJ ten minutes before doors. Say what happened, what state
the drive is in, and what to do. Never make someone guess whether their library survived.
