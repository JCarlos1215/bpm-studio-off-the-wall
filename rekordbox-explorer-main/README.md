Your library lives on a USB stick you cannot inspect without installing a 1 GB
application. This reads that stick's `export.pdb` directly in the browser — the whole
binary parser runs client-side, there is no server, and your library never leaves your
machine.

## What it does

| | |
|---|---|
| ⚡ **Reads your drive instantly** | Tracks, artists, albums, genres, keys, labels, the full playlist tree. |
| 🔍 **Search and sort** | Resizable, reorderable columns. Browse raw files too. |
| ▶️ **Auditions your tracks** | Play straight off the stick — including AIFF, which no Chromium can play on its own. |
| 🚑 **Rescues a drive that died** | Finds an intact library when the one rekordbox uses was cut off mid-write. |
| 📄 **PDF setlists** | Printable, respects your visible columns. |
| 🎛️ **Tells you the truth about hardware** | Which players will read this drive, and which will not. |
| 🌗 **Readable in a dark booth** | Four themes, font scaling, works on a phone. |

## Quick start

1. Plug in your rekordbox USB.
2. Open the app in **Chrome, Edge or Opera** on a desktop.
3. Click **Select USB or Folder** and pick the drive's root.

**On iPhone / iPad / Safari / Firefox:** these browsers cannot open folders. Tap
**Select export.pdb File**, then navigate to `PIONEER` → `rekordbox` → `export.pdb`.

## Will my player read it?

| Hardware | Reads `export.pdb` |
|---|---|
| CDJ-2000 / nexus / NXS2, CDJ-900 | ✅ |
| CDJ-3000 (firmware ≤ 3.22) | ✅ |
| XDJ-1000 / RX / RX2 / XZ | ✅ |
| **OPUS-QUAD, OMNIS-DUO, XDJ-AZ, CDJ-3000X** | ✅ reads OneLibrary |

Newer gear reads **OneLibrary** (`PIONEER/rekordbox/exportLibrary.db`), a SQLCipher-encrypted
SQLite database that rekordbox writes *alongside* the legacy one. This app reads both, and
tells you which decks your drive will actually work in — including the case that catches
people out, where a drive has only OneLibrary and is therefore invisible to every older CDJ.

If your drive is missing one of the two, re-export it from **rekordbox 6.6.11 or later**;
both libraries can live on the same stick.

## Auditioning tracks

Double-click a row (single tap on a phone) and it plays from the stick. The queue is
whatever is on screen, so skip forward and back follow your current sort and filter.

| Format | Plays? |
|---|---|
| MP3, WAV, FLAC | ✅ browser plays it |
| **AIFF** | ✅ **decoded here** — no Chromium plays AIFF, by any route |
| WAV 24-bit / 32-bit float / extensible | ✅ decoded here when the browser refuses |
| AAC / M4A | ✅ wherever the browser ships the codec — Chrome does |
| ALAC | ❌ nothing can preview it. Named plainly, and it still plays on a CDJ. |

Support is **probed at runtime**, not assumed from the file extension: which formats a
browser refuses depends on the build, not just the brand, and the failure mode of guessing
wrong is silence.

## When a drive dies

Pull a stick without ejecting and rekordbox's databases can stop mid-write. **Settings →
Attempt USB recovery** looks for a library that survived — a stick usually carries several,
written at different times, and only the one that was open is damaged. It checks the legacy
`export.pdb`, OneLibrary, journals and `-wal` files, and an Engine DJ library if the drive
has one.

It is **read-only** — it never writes to your drive — and it outputs rekordbox XML, which
you import to have rekordbox rebuild the drive properly.

It also tells you when a file is *unwritten* rather than corrupt. Those are different
problems, and only one of them has a fix.

## Project state

Two branches, on purpose:

| Branch | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **`main`** | The **viewer** described above | ✅ Live |
| **`for-later`** | The **playlist editor**: create/edit playlists and write them back to the USB, with dual verified on-drive backups, a verified write pipeline with automatic rollback, a cross-drive device registry, six export formats, and 252 tests | ⏸️ Built, then rolled back from production. Parked pending diagnosis. |

The editor release was merged, deployed, and rolled back after issues in production. The
work is intact on `for-later`; nothing was lost. What is known, what is suspected, and
what has to happen before it re-lands is written up in **[`memorystate.md`](memorystate.md)**
and **[`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md)**.

**If you hit a bug, a console error is worth more than a bug report.** That is the one
thing currently blocking the editor from shipping.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:8080
npm run build
npm test
```

React 18 · Vite · TypeScript · Tailwind · shadcn/ui. No backend, no accounts. The binary
parser is hand-written against the
[crate-digger](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/crate-digger) Kaitai spec, and so are the
AIFF and WAV decoders — there is no audio library in the dependency tree.

`npm run dev` then open `/preview.html` to see the player against fixture tracks, without
needing a USB plugged in.

### Run it inside the local BPM Studio project on macOS

From the parent project folder, double-click `Iniciar BPM Studio.command`. It serves the
parent folder on `127.0.0.1:8080` and opens the local BPM Studio page, where Rekordbox
Explorer is embedded from this project's `dist/` folder. The same page also serves a
silent, browser-compatible H.264 background video with byte-range support. The original
WebM background is kept in the project folder. Keep the Terminal window open while using
it. The bundled build and its assets are served locally; no hosted homepage is needed.

## Privacy

Your library never leaves the browser. The hosted build loads Vercel's analytics script
for anonymous page-view counts — details in [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md).
